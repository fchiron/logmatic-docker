# logmatic-docker
The Logmatic.io's container finds all your running containers' logs and stream it to your platform

# Use the image available on docker hub

This container as for unique option to pass the api key of your Logmatic.io's platform.

So to use the image available on docker hub simply run the following command:

```
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock logmatic/logmatic-docker <your_api_key>
```

The mapping to the docker socket is really important as this is why we are able to identify all the running containers and follow their logs.

Nothing more to do.

# Options

Several options are allowed after the api key.

```
> logmatic-docker [apiKey]
   [-a ATTR (eg myattribute="my attribute")] //Several times ok
   [-h HOSTNAME (default "api.logmatic.io")] [-p PORT (default "10514")]
   [--matchByImage REGEXP] [--matchByName REGEXP]
   [--skipByImage REGEXP] [--skipByName REGEXP]
   [--withDockerEvents [BOOLEAN] (default true)]
```

## Add extra attributes

You can add extra attributes to all the pushed entries by chaining the option "--attr" or "-a".

## Match / Skip by name or image

If you don't want all your containers to send log entries to Logmatic.io you can user the options `--matchByImage`, `--matchByName`, `--skipByImage` or `--skipByName`.

However, use one inclusion/exclusion policy as these options cannot live together.

## Send Docker events

By default, [Docker events](#the-docker-events) are sent to Logmatic.io, but you can use the option `--withDockerEvents` and set it to `false` if you decide not to send them.

# What are the data types sent to Logmatic.io?

This container sends 2 things:

- the log data published by your containers
- and the docker events

## The log data

The log data is published as is associated with some meta-data that identifies the container.
An NGINX log for instance would look like this:

```json
{
  "image": "nginx",
  "id": "<container_id>",
  "name": "<container_name",
  "v": "<version>",
  "message": "192.168.99.1 - - [15/Dec/2015:17:36:50 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.2526.80 Safari/537.36\" \"-\""
}
```

## The docker events

Docker events tells you the activity on your docker machine: create, kill, commit, etc...

```json
{
  "image": "<image_name>",
  "id": "<container_id>",
  "name": "<container_name>",
  "host": "<your_host>",
  "type": "create",
  "message": "[Docker event] host=\"a5900527eead577df14c7917e83f0b6ebeb7b3d103e44d0a93a1c05316c6d391\" name=\"boring_hypatia\" event=\"create\""
}
```
